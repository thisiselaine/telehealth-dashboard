# Telehealth Options Educational Dashboard

## Project Overview

The **Telehealth Options Educational Dashboard** is a web-based application written in Rust, designed to educate users about their telehealth options, help them navigate various providers, and book appointments. The project aims to bridge the gap between users and healthcare providers by offering a clear, interactive, and secure way to access telehealth services. 

Many users living in areas that either have low broadband access or are remote hesitate to use telehealth services as a way to get the care that they need due to lack of trust or digital literacy. This platform is meant to be a way to provide those educational resources by creating an easy-to-use, secure interface that encourages and explores users' options to manage their health online.

## Objectives

### **Educational Outreach**
The dashboard will present resources to help users understand the telehealth landscape, including which services are available, how telehealth works, and what options are most suitable for them based on their medical needs and insurance.

### **User-Centric Telehealth Search**
The application will support users who want to:
- Filter telehealth providers by location, medical specialty, and insurance compatibility.
- Access a user-friendly interface to compare services like video consultations, chat-based support, or phone consultations, linking users directly to websites where they can book appointments.

Concurrency and scalability features afforded by the Rust programming language will ensure that multiple users can connect to the dashboard at once without compromising the responsiveness of the dashboard.

### **Real-Time Data and Appointment Availability**
Leverage real-time data from telehealth providers to:
- Display up-to-date service availability and appointment slots.
- Allow users to check insurance compatibility instantly.
- Provide alerts when new appointments become available or when providers are about to fill up.

### **Privacy and Security**
Ensure privacy and data protection for users by:
- Implementing encryption for sensitive user data, especially around personal health information (PHI) and insurance details.

## Technologies Used

- **Rust**: Chosen for its performance, memory safety, and concurrency features, ensuring a secure and fast platform.
- **APIs**: Integration with third-party telehealth provider APIs to fetch real-time data on available services and appointment slots.
